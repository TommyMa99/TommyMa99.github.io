        Mountain Bike Trail Near Seattle Area<br>As a mountain bike enthusiast, I have been to multiple mountain bike park and Trail
        in both Seattle and North Carolina. With the natural advantages of pacific north west, Seattle bike park has triumphed over all the
        other bike park I have been to. One of my favorite one here is called Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park. It has been the most astonishing
        and exciting bike park. Around 30 minutes of ride from Bellevue, you can reach the trail heaad and starts the fun. There are twenty ish
        trails to choose from. There are beginner friendly trails, climbing heavy trails, dirt jump tracks, pump tracks, and some really dangerous
        features equvallent to a double diamond trail in skiing. One of the best dirt jumping track is "Ryan's Eternal Flow", and I have fell deep in love
        with it the first time hitting it. Starting with a smooth table, followed by a scary small road gaps, the fun has started before you realize.
